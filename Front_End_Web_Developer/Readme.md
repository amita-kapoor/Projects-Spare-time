The Front End Developer Nanodegree program is composed of five projects. With each project, you'll create something that demonstrates your mastery of in-demand skills. Projects range in complexity, and each builds upon the previous. In the end, you will have a resume-worthy portfolio that you can showcase to prospective employers.
